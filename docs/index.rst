Graphical user interface
========================

This module provides a graphical user interface for the `tingbot <http://tingbot.com>`_.
It allows you to include some of the commoner elements (also known as widgets) of your phone or computer 
interface within your application, rather than having to develop them from scratch.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] I'm English, so I use the english spelling of *colour*. However, historically the majority of software was
       written in the USA, so in software, the standard is to spell it *color*.
.. [#] Actually there are several ways of specifying a colour, many of which are better than simple red
       green and blue. However, red green and blue is simplest, so we'll stick with that for this example.
       See the Wikipedia entry on `color spaces <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space>`_ for more detail
       than you can possibly want.
